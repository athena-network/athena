### How To Compile

On Linux or Mac on a non standard architecture, and can't get GNU Readline installed?

Disable it with `cmake .. -DFORCE_READLINE=FALSE`


#### Linux

##### Prerequisites

- You will need the following packages: boost (1.55 or higher), rocksdb, cmake, git, gcc (4.9 or higher), g++ (4.9 or higher), make, GNU readline, and python. Most of these should already be installed on your system.
- For example on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python-dev gcc g++ git cmake libboost-all-dev librocksdb-dev libreadline-dev`
- If you are using Ubuntu and your version of Ubuntu doesn't have librocksdb-dev, you can get it from a ppa instead:


##### Building

- `git clone https://github.com/athena-network/athena`
- `cd athena`
- `mkdir build && cd $_`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`

#### Apple

##### Prerequisites

- Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/). See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23849962/cmake-installer-for-mac-fails-to-create-usr-bin-symlinks) if you are unable call `cmake` from the terminal after installing.
- Install the [boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries. Either compile boost manually or run `brew install boost`.
- Install [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) by running `brew install readline; brew link --force readline`. - Make sure you run this full command, or it will link the wrong version of readline
- Install XCode and Developer Tools.

##### Building

- `git clone https://github.com/athena-network/athena`
- `cd athena`
- `mkdir build && cd $_`
- `cmake ..` or `cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=<path_to_boost_install> ..` when building
  from a specific boost install. If you used brew to install boost, your path is most likely `/usr/local/include/boost.`
- `make`

The binaries will be in `./src` after compilation is complete.

Run `./src/athena` to connect to the network and let it sync (it may take a while).

#### Windows 10

##### Prerequisites
- Install [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15&page=inlineinstall)
- When installing Visual Studio, it is **required** that you install **Desktop development with C++** and the **VC++ v140 toolchain** when selecting features. The option to install the v140 toolchain can be found by expanding the "Desktop development with C++" node on the right. You will need this for the project to build correctly.
- Install [Boost 1.59.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.59.0/), ensuring you download the installer for MSVC 14.

##### Building

- From the start menu, open 'x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for vs2017'.
- `cd <your_athena_directory>`
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- Set the PATH variable for cmake: ie. `set PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin";%PATH%`
- `cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" .. -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_59_0` (Or your boost installed dir.)
- `MSBuild Athena.sln /p:Configuration=Release /m`
- If all went well, it will complete successfully, and you will find all your binaries in the '..\build\src\Release' directory.
- Additionally, a `.sln` file will have been created in the `build` directory. If you wish to open the project in Visual Studio with this, you can.
